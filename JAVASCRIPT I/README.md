# ABOUT JAVASCRIPT

In 1990 when the internet was boomed computers try to make websites. Two companies Microsoft (Internet Explorer) and Netscape have a browser war. Netscape was won by building a lightweight language in 10 days first the founder called it a mocha. More and more companies have used JavaScript to create their site over time

Nowadays JavaScript is the essential web technology that most browsers are supported. JavaScript will continue to grow as an indispensable language for web development.

## JavaScript on the Web

The main component of the web is HTML CSS and JS(JavaScript)
We can think of HTML as noun CSS as adjective and JavaScript as Verb

## Popularity of JavaScript

Why a programming language that builds in 10 days and by just a guy. Well because with javaScript we can write an application platform on the browser

- It’s can run on the front and back end
- Update frequently
- Integrated to work well with HTML and CSS
- JavaScript allows websites to have interactivity like scroll transitions and object movement
- JavaScript offers a wide range of frameworks and libraries that help developers create complex applications with low overhead. Programmers can import libraries and frameworks into their code to augment their application’s functionality.

## JavaScript for the server

JavaScript is not just used for the front-end it also works for the back-end. Node-js is a popular server-side for JavaScript.

## What else can JavaScript do?

Beyond the web, JavaScript has a large presence amongst cross-platform applications. We use some popular standalone desktop apps like Slack, GitHub, Skype, and Tidal. These applications are developed with the JavaScript framework called Electron.js. Electron is excellent for making desktop applications that need to work across different devices regardless of the operating system.

In addition, JavaScript has the potential of expanding into other innovative technologies such as virtual reality and gaming. JavaScript can be used for animating, rendering and scaling. JavaScript even has contributed to the internet of things, the technology that makes simple objects, like your fridge, smarter. Everyday devices can become interactive and collect data using JavaScript libraries.
