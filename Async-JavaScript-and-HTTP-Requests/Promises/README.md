## Introduction

- **********\*\*\***********asynchronous operation**********\*\*\*********** is the operation that allows the computer to **move on** to another task while waiting for the asynchronous operation to complete.
- This means no part of our program has to be stopped.
  - e.g when we washcloth in the washing machine in the meantime we can take that free time to do something else.
  - e.g in Web Dev when requesting an API or backend database it has to take time so asynchronous code allows us to execute another task while waiting for that request to complete.
- Weâ€™ll use **promise** it an ES6 to handle asynchronous code.
