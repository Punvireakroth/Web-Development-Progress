A filesystem organize files and directories into a tree stucture

1. The first directory in filesystem is `root directory`
2. Each Parent directory can contain one or more files or directories

First thing you see in the terminal is $ sign it is called `shell prompt`

`$ ls` the terminal would display our current directory's file and directory
