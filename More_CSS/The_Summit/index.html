      <h3>THE EXPERIENCE</h3>
      <p>
        The Summit is the geographical center of the the <span>Breckenridge</span> Ski Area. It also has the widest variety of terrain, from beginner trails to steep bowl terrain. Lower Peak 8
        consists of beginner trails, as well as many intermediate trails mixed with some advanced runs. There are four lifts out of the base area: Lift 7, which services a beginner learning area; Lift
        5, which services more advanced beginner terrain, the Freeway and Park Lane Terrain Parks, and the Alpine Slide. At the north end of the base area, the Colorado SuperChair provides access to
        the Vista Haus, central Peak 8, as well as access to the Peak 8 back bowls and Peak 9, while the Rocky Mountain SuperChair provides access to northern Peak 8, the T-Bar, Peak 7, and Peak 6.
