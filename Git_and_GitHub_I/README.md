# Basic Git Workflow

## Introduction

Git allows you to make keep track of the change in our project and also allows us to refer to the version we want.

## git init

`init` mean initialize mean we're ready to keep track changes on the project.

## Git Workflow

Git project have three parts

1. `Working directory` where you creating, editing, deleting, and organizing files
2. `Staging Area` where you making changes and ready to commit
3. `Repository` Where git permanently store those change as different versions of the project.

   Git workflow consists of editing files in the `working directory`, adding files to the `staging area`, and saving changes to a Git `repository`.

## git status

When you making change in a file you can check it with `git status`

Note: when you see `untracked files` it mean Git see the file but has not stated tracking changes yet.

## git add

As I Mention above untracked files are files that git doesn't tracking yet so to make git track those file we need to use `git add "filename"`

## git diff

After we added files to the staging area. But we have typed and make changes after that so if we wanna know the difference between the working directory and staging area we can use `git diff filename`

## git commit

When we use `git commit` we finally store the files in staging area to the repository. it mean we save change a version we satisfy with.

## git log

we can refer back to the earlier version of a project by using `git log`

the output would display

Characters code, called a SHA, that uniquely identifies the commit. This appears in orange text.
The commit author (you!)
The date and time of the commit
The commit message

# How to Backtrack

## Intro

Git have features that allow us to undo mistakes when working on project.

## head commit

the commit your currently on or recently made commit is called `HEAD`

```
git show HEAD
```

## git checkout

```
git checkout HEAD filename
```

It's will restore your file in working directory.

## more git add

You can add more than one file to the staging area

```
git add file1 file2
```

## git reset I

We can unstage the file from the staging area using

`git reset HEAD filename`

## git reset II

To retracing your step (commit) we can use

```
git reset commit_SHA
```

For example `git reset 5d69206`

# Git Operations

## git stash

`git stash` will store work temporarily for later use in a hidden file. After you finish and ready to continue working on the file you have stashed you can use `git stash pop`.

## git log

`git log --oneline` shows the list of commits in one line format.

`git log -S "keyword"` displays a list of commits that contain the keyword in the message

## Git commit amend

`git commit --amend` is use to update the prevoius commit. This is useful when we have to change but don't want to create a new commit.

# GitHub

Git is a development tool while GitHub is a service.

Why GitHub ?

- To show what you Learning/Create in repository
- Tracking changes made to your code
- offers a hosting service and tools to build test, and deploy code

# GitHub Flow

- Create a branch
- Commit changes
- Create a pull request
- Review pull request
- Merge and delete branch

## Branches

When we're working with a team there a lot of people so what do we do when we want to experimental the code, fix the bug, create a new feature? 
Git allow you to create `branche` which mean each member can work on their code and does not affect the main branche. What is the main branche you may ask. It's essentially where all the bug free and clean code go to ultimately or we can say it is the working version of a project and contains the production code.

We need to consider the descriptive and understable branche name e.g vireakroth_feature_dashboard_notifications. This includes the author, branch type, and short branch description. Some company may name their branche which ticket name as the project management tool they using.

## Create pull request

When you want to get your code into the main branch you first need to create a pull request. This means you are in the process of reviewing or protentially make changes of the code. 
When you do the pull request make sure to
- Give enough detials in other to make rewiewer easy to understand what you did
- Don't pull request after a huge changes

## Review and Merging a Pull request

As a reviewer you need to review and approve(merge) code to the main branch. you can click on the plus button to give comment and each line of the pull request.

These are best practice for reviewer 

- Donâ€™t only comment on what should be changed, but why it should be changed. Feel free to provide resources to make your point.

- Be as clear as possible with your comments and make sure to be clear as to what to modify.

- Look at the bigger picture and try to spot potential errors. Would the submitted code produce any obstacles if the project scales?

## Delete Branches 

Once the code is merged it good to keep things organize. Thus it is a good idea to delete branches that already close which mean the code on that branches is already marged.

# Markdown

- Markdown provide you way to document and show what your project is about in a nice visaul way
- It's eventially converted to HTML

To make h1 we use == under the text to make h2 we use -- under the text.
You can also use # symbols to produce heading as well.

```
My Todo List
============
 
At the end of this **week**, I plan to:
 
1. Learn Markdown
2. Write Markdown
3. Share a Markdown note
 
My favorite quote is:
> If you didn't get it the first time
> Do not despair
> Try and try again
> ~ Anonymous
```
